# Steps for creating a github page and make the domain name point to it

## Create a repository
1, log into your github and just creat a reposoitory of yourname.github.io, here replace the yourname into your own github account name. Here in my case I create the repository of monero-classic-lab.github.io.
2, just add the first file of index.html to the repository, and fill the file of index.html with anything you like.
3, what for a while and then visist the page of yourname.github.io, make sure replace the yourname of your own github account name. Here in my case is [monero-classic-lab.github.io](monero-classic-lab.github.io)
